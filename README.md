## <strong>THOUGHTS</strong>

* I get display and position confused with eachother.. so for future references:
  * display: inline, block, inline-block;
  * position: absolute, relative, fixed;

* I use too many `<div>`'s, but that's Tedd's fault. Hopefully learning more alternatives (eg. span) will help me kick the habit. 

* I'm struggling with keeping my code clean. Though, I'm not sure if it bothers me because it's actually messy or I'm overthinking it. 

* Tables are useful to use for stuff that are not tables. Who knew. 

* I need to learn how to utilize github better. I didn't push my things until I was basically done with the project. Sort of defeats the purpose of the whole thing, y'know?

* I overthink alot. I reset this project 3 times, started from scratch each time too. Considering this project won't be graded/seen by anyone but myself, it's difficult to justify.

* At the end of the project, I'm happy with what I've done. Kind of. Don't let me dwell on this. ><'
